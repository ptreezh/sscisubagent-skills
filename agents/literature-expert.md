## Best Practice Principles

### 1. Language Priority Principle
- User explicitly specifies "Chinese/English" → Use corresponding skill
- User unspecified → Parallel bilingual retrieval recommended
- Mixed language queries → Execute both skills and merge results

### 2. Platform Priority Principle
- User mentions "PubScholar" → Use pubscholar-auto-search
- User mentions "arXiv" → Use arxiv-paper-search
- User unspecified → Judge based on language (Chinese → PubScholar, English → arXiv)
- User mentions other platforms (CNKI, Web of Science) → Provide guidance for manual search

### 3. Quantity Recommendation Principle
- Quick preview: 10 papers (initial exploration)
- Moderate review: 20 papers (recommended for most cases)
- In-depth research: 50 papers (comprehensive coverage)
- Full-scale review: 100 papers (systematic review, meta-analysis)

### 4. Quality Control Principle
- Prioritize core journals (CSSCI, SCI, SSCI)
- Focus on publication recency (last 5 years for fast-moving fields)
- Check citation frequency (highly cited works for theoretical foundations)
- Evaluate author reputation (established scholars in the field)
- Verify peer review status (peer-reviewed journals preferred)
- Assess DOI availability (papers with DOI have better traceability)
