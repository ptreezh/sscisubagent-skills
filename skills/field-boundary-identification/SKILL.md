# Field Boundary Identification Skill

## Overview
场域边界识别技能专注于识别和分析社会场域的边界、范围和排除机制。该技能帮助研究者确定场域的界限、理解边界维持机制、分析场域内外的关系以及识别场域的特殊性。

## When to Use This Skill
Use this skill when the user requests:
- Definition of field boundaries and scope
- Analysis of inclusion and exclusion mechanisms
- Identification of field-specific rules and principles
- Examination of field boundaries in historical context
- Analysis of field autonomy and independence
- Understanding of field-specific logic
- Study of relationships between fields
- Investigation of boundary maintenance and change processes

## Quick Start
When a user requests boundary identification:
1. **Define** the field of analysis
2. **Identify** the boundaries and limits
3. **Analyze** inclusion and exclusion mechanisms
4. **Map** relationships with other fields
5. **Assess** boundary permeability and stability

## Core Functions (Progressive Disclosure)

### Primary Functions
- **Field Definition**: Clearly define the field of analysis
- **Boundary Mapping**: Identify the spatial and conceptual boundaries
- **Inclusion Mechanisms**: Identify how actors are included in the field
- **Exclusion Mechanisms**: Identify how actors are excluded from the field

### Secondary Functions
- **Rule Analysis**: Examine field-specific rules and principles
- **Logic Identification**: Identify the specific logic of the field
- **Autonomy Assessment**: Evaluate independence from external forces
- **Boundary Negotiation**: Analyze processes of boundary contestation

### Advanced Functions
- **Multi-field Analysis**: Examine relationships with adjacent fields
- **Boundary Dynamics**: Analyze processes of boundary change
- **Historical Boundary Analysis**: Trace boundary evolution over time
- **Boundary Permeability**: Assess the porosity of field boundaries

## Detailed Instructions

### 1. Field Definition
   - Clearly define the field of analysis
   - Specify the type of field (educational, political, cultural, economic, etc.)
   - Establish the historical and geographical context
   - Determine the appropriate time frame for analysis
   - Identify the key actors and institutions involved

### 2. Boundary Mapping
   - Identify the spatial boundaries of the field
   - Map the conceptual boundaries of the field
   - Analyze the institutional boundaries
   - Consider the symbolic boundaries
   - Examine the temporal boundaries

### 3. Inclusion Mechanisms Analysis
   - Identify the mechanisms that include actors in the field
   - Analyze the criteria for field membership
   - Examine the processes of field entry
   - Consider the resources required for field participation
   - Map the pathways to field membership

### 4. Exclusion Mechanisms Analysis
   - Identify the mechanisms that exclude actors from the field
   - Analyze the barriers to field entry
   - Examine the forms of field exclusion
   - Consider the effects of exclusion on excluded actors
   - Map the consequences of exclusion for the field

### 5. Rule and Logic Analysis
   - Identify the specific rules governing the field
   - Analyze the logic specific to the field
   - Examine how the field logic differs from external logics
   - Consider the relationship between field rules and field boundaries
   - Assess the stability of field-specific logic

### 6. Autonomy Assessment
   - Evaluate the field's autonomy from external forces
   - Analyze the degree of field-specific logic
   - Identify mechanisms of symbolic violence
   - Assess the field's historical development
   - Consider the relationship between autonomy and boundaries

### 7. Multi-field Relationships
   - Examine relationships with adjacent fields
   - Analyze boundary interactions and exchanges
   - Consider the effects of neighboring fields on boundary maintenance
   - Map the dependencies between fields
   - Assess the impact of inter-field relationships on boundary stability

### 8. Boundary Dynamics
   - Trace the historical evolution of field boundaries
   - Analyze moments of boundary contestation
   - Examine processes of boundary change
   - Consider the factors driving boundary shifts
   - Assess the consequences of boundary changes

## Parameters
- `field_type`: Type of field (educational, political, cultural, economic, etc.)
- `boundary_scope`: Scope of boundary analysis (spatial, conceptual, institutional)
- `inclusion_criteria`: Criteria for field membership
- `exclusion_mechanisms`: Mechanisms of field exclusion
- `autonomy_level`: Level of field autonomy to assess
- `time_frame`: Time period for historical boundary analysis
- `multi_field`: Relationship with adjacent fields to examine
- `methodology`: Approach to boundary analysis (qualitative, ethnographic, etc.)
- `cultural_context`: Cultural context considerations (especially for Chinese context)

## Examples

### Example 1: Educational Field Boundary
User: "Analyze the boundaries of the Chinese university field"
Response: Define field scope, identify admission requirements, analyze exclusion mechanisms, assess autonomy from external forces.

### Example 2: Artistic Field Boundary
User: "Examine the boundaries of the contemporary Chinese art field"
Response: Map institutional boundaries, analyze inclusion/exclusion mechanisms, assess autonomy from market/political forces.

### Example 3: Political Field Boundary
User: "Study the boundaries of local governance in Chinese cities"
Response: Define field scope, identify actor inclusion/exclusion criteria, analyze relationships with higher authorities.
