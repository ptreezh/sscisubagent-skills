   - Analyze the strategies actors use to acquire capitals
   - Examine the conflicts arising from capital competition
   - Consider the stakes of capital competitions
   - Map the alliances and oppositions based on capital holdings

### 4. Conversion Mechanism Analysis
   - Identify the mechanisms for converting one capital type to another
   - Analyze the conditions under which conversions occur
   - Assess the efficiency of different conversion mechanisms
   - Consider the obstacles to capital conversion
   - Examine the rates of conversion in the field

### 5. Capital Inequality Analysis
   - Assess the level of inequality in different capital types
   - Identify the causes of capital inequalities
   - Analyze the consequences of capital inequalities
   - Consider the effects on field dynamics
   - Map the reproduction of inequalities

### 6. Legitimacy and Recognition Analysis
   - Examine how capitals gain legitimacy in the field
   - Analyze the processes of capital recognition
   - Consider the challenges to capital legitimacy
   - Assess the role of field authorities in legitimizing capitals
   - Map the symbolic struggle over capital recognition

### 7. Power Relations Analysis
   - Analyze how capital distribution affects power relations
   - Examine the connection between capital and authority
   - Consider the mechanisms of capital-based power
   - Assess the resistance to capital-based power
   - Map the transformations of power relations

### 8. Reproduction Mechanism Analysis
   - Identify the mechanisms for reproducing capitals
   - Analyze the transmission of capitals across generations
   - Examine the institutional support for capital reproduction
   - Consider the challenges to reproduction mechanisms
   - Assess the evolution of reproduction patterns
