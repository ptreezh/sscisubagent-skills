# ANT Participant Identification Skill

## Overview
ANT参与者识别技能专注于识别和分类行动者网络中的各类参与者（人类和非人类），分析他们的特征、角色和在网络中的位置。该技能帮助研究者全面识别网络中的行动者，并理解他们的基本属性和关系。

## When to Use This Skill
Use this skill when the user requests:
- Identification of actors in a socio-technical network
- Classification of human and non-human actors
- Analysis of actor characteristics and roles
- Mapping of initial network configuration
- Recognition of agency in both human and non-human actors
- Determination of actor importance in a network
- Identification of central vs. peripheral actors

## Quick Start
When a user requests participant identification:
1. **Identify** all relevant human actors
2. **Recognize** non-human actors (technologies, objects, concepts)
3. **Classify** actors by type and role
4. **Map** actor relationships and connections
5. **Assess** agency of different actors

## Core Functions (Progressive Disclosure)

### Primary Functions
- **Human Actor Recognition**: Identify individuals, organizations, groups
- **Non-Human Actor Recognition**: Identify technologies, materials, concepts, documents
- **Actor Classification**: Categorize actors by type and function
- **Agency Assessment**: Evaluate the agency of different actors

### Secondary Functions
- **Role Analysis**: Determine the roles actors play in the network
- **Position Mapping**: Map actors' positions within the network
- **Relationship Identification**: Identify connections between actors
- **Influence Assessment**: Evaluate actors' potential influence

### Advanced Functions
- **Actor Translation Tracking**: Follow how actors' roles change
- **Hybrid Actor Analysis**: Analyze actors that combine human/non-human elements
- **Actor Network Boundaries**: Define network boundaries
- **Actor Power Dynamics**: Examine power relations between actors

## Detailed Instructions

### 1. Human Actor Identification
   - Identify individual actors (persons, experts, users, etc.)
   - Identify organizational actors (companies, institutions, agencies)
   - Identify collective actors (communities, movements, groups)
   - Determine actors' interests and motivations
   - Assess actors' resources and capabilities

### 2. Non-Human Actor Recognition
   - Identify technological actors (devices, systems, platforms)
   - Identify material actors (resources, infrastructure, tools)
   - Identify conceptual actors (theories, ideas, frameworks)
   - Identify document actors (policies, contracts, records)
   - Identify natural actors (environment, climate, geography)

### 3. Actor Classification
   - Classify by agency type (high, medium, low)
   - Classify by network position (central, peripheral, bridging)
   - Classify by role (mediator, intermediary, translator)
   - Classify by stability (stable, changing, temporary)

### 4. Agency Assessment
   - Evaluate the capacity to act and influence
   - Assess the ability to mediate other actors' actions
   - Determine the degree of autonomy in action
   - Consider the actor's capacity to resist or modify influences

### 5. Relationship Mapping
   - Identify direct connections between actors
   - Map the strength of relationships
   - Assess the nature of interactions (supportive, conflicting, neutral)
   - Consider potential for translation between actors

### 6. Network Position Analysis
   - Identify central vs. peripheral actors
   - Determine brokerage or bridging positions
   - Assess the actor's connectivity within the network
   - Consider the actor's role in network stability

## Parameters
- `actor_type`: Type of actor to focus on (human, non-human, hybrid)
- `network_scope`: Scope of network to analyze
- `agency_level`: Level of agency to assess (high, medium, low)
- `role_focus`: Specific roles to emphasize (mediator, intermediary, translator)
- `classification_scheme`: Framework for classifying actors
- `boundary_criteria`: Criteria for defining network boundaries
- `methodology`: Approach to actor identification (qualitative, ethnographic, etc.)

## Examples

### Example 1: Technology Adoption Network
User: "Identify actors in the adoption of electric vehicles in China"
Response: Identify government agencies, car manufacturers, consumers, charging infrastructure, battery technology, environmental concerns, regulations.

### Example 2: Healthcare Network
User: "Identify actors in a telemedicine implementation"
Response: Identify doctors, patients, hospital administrators, medical devices, digital platforms, health data, medical protocols, regulatory bodies.

### Example 3: Policy Implementation
User: "Identify actors in rural education policy implementation"
Response: Identify government officials, teachers, students, parents, schools, educational technology, textbooks, internet infrastructure, local communities.

## Quality Standards

- Apply generalized symmetry principle (equal consideration of human/non-human actors)
- Identify both obvious and hidden actors
- Consider actors at multiple scales (local, regional, global)
- Assess agency rather than assuming it
- Maintain focus on relational properties of actors

## Output Format

- Complete actor inventory with classifications
- Actor characteristic profiles
- Network position mappings
- Agency assessment matrices
- Relationship connection maps

## Resources
- Actor-Network Theory literature (Latour, Callon, Law)
- Actor identification methodologies
- Science and Technology Studies resources
- Examples of actor identification in Chinese context
