# Actor-Network Theory (ANT) Analysis Skill

## Overview
行动者网络理论(ANT)分析技能为社会科学研究提供分析异质性行动者网络、追踪转译过程和理解技术社会互动的框架。该技能帮助研究者识别人类和非人类行动者、构建关系网络、追踪网络构建过程并分析网络动态。

## When to Use This Skill
Use this skill when the user requests:
- Analysis of socio-technical networks involving humans and non-humans
- Identification of actors (human and non-human) in a network
- Tracing of translation processes and network construction
- Analysis of how facts, technologies, or practices are constructed
- Understanding of power relations in heterogeneous networks
- Investigation of how networks stabilize or destabilize
- Examination of the role of material objects in social processes
- Study of innovation processes and technology adoption
- Analysis of policy networks and implementation processes
- Investigation of scientific knowledge construction

## Quick Start
When a user requests ANT analysis:
1. **Map** all relevant human and non-human actors
2. **Trace** connections and relationships between actors
3. **Follow** translation processes (problematisation to mobilization)
4. **Analyze** material-semiotic relations
5. **Assess** network stability and dynamics

## Core Functions (Progressive Disclosure)

### Primary Functions
- **Actor Mapping**: Identify human and non-human actors in the network
- **Relationship Tracing**: Map connections between actors
- **Translation Process**: Follow problematisation to enrolment phases
- **Basic Material Analysis**: Recognize non-human agency

### Secondary Functions
- **Network Topology**: Map the structure of relationships
- **Stability Analysis**: Assess factors maintaining network stability
- **Power Relations**: Examine how power operates through networks
- **Socio-Material Analysis**: Understand human-non-human entanglements

### Advanced Functions
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Track changes in network structure over time
- **Scripting Analysis**: Examine how technologies embody social relations
- **Closure Analysis**: Analyze how controversies are settled
- **Multi-scalar Analysis**: Connect local and global network elements

## Detailed Instructions

### 1. Actor Mapping
   - Identify all relevant human and non-human actors
   - Determine the relationships between actors
   - Assess the agency of different actors
   - Map the initial network configuration
   - Consider both central and peripheral actors

### 2. Network Analysis
   - Trace the connections between actors
   - Analyze the strength and nature of relationships
   - Identify key mediators and mediators of translation
   - Map the network topology
   - Consider network boundaries and exclusions

### 3. Translation Process Tracing
   - Identify the problematisation phase
   - Trace the interessement and enrollment processes
   - Analyze mobilization strategies
   - Examine how interests are translated
   - Consider moments of translation failure

### 4. Material Semiotics Analysis
   - Examine the agency of non-human actors
   - Analyze socio-material entanglements
   - Identify scripting in technologies and objects
   - Consider how material arrangements shape social relations
   - Understand the performativity of material arrangements

### 5. Network Dynamics Assessment
   - Analyze factors that stabilize or destabilize the network
   - Identify moments of change and transformation
   - Examine power relations within the network
   - Consider potential future developments
   - Assess the robustness of the network

### 6. Synthesis and Interpretation
   - Integrate findings from all dimensions
   - Connect ANT analysis to broader social processes
   - Consider Chinese social context and cultural specificities
   - Provide actionable insights

## Parameters
- `network_type`: Type of network (technological, scientific, organizational, etc.)
- `actors_of_interest`: Specific actors to focus on
- `time_frame`: Time period for analysis (synchronic, diachronic)
- `translation_phase`: Focus on specific translation phases
- `material_focus`: Emphasis on non-human actors
- `methodology`: Approach to ANT analysis (qualitative, ethnographic, etc.)
- `cultural_context`: Cultural context considerations (especially for Chinese context)

## Examples

### Example 1: Technology Adoption
User: "Analyze the adoption of mobile payment systems in China using ANT"
Response: Map human and non-human actors, trace translation processes, analyze network stabilization.

### Example 2: Scientific Network
User: "Study how a scientific fact was constructed using ANT"
Response: Identify actors, trace problematisation and enrollment, analyze material-semiotic relations.

### Example 3: Policy Network
User: "Examine the network involved in a policy implementation"
Response: Map policy actors, analyze translation processes, assess network stability.

## Quality Standards

- Apply ANT principles rigorously (generalized symmetry, translation)
