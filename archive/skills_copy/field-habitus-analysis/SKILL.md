# Field Habitus Analysis Skill

## Overview
场域习性分析技能专注于分析社会场域中行动者的习性模式，包括他们的行为倾向、认知结构、实践逻辑以及习性与场域结构之间的相互关系。该技能帮助研究者理解行动者的内在倾向如何与场域的客观条件相匹配，以及这种匹配如何影响实践活动。

## When to Use This Skill
Use this skill when the user requests:
- Analysis of habitus and its relationship to field structure
- Understanding of action dispositions and behavioral tendencies
- Examination of practice logic and embodied knowledge
- Study of how habitus enables and constrains practice
- Investigation of the correspondence between habitus and field
- Analysis of how habitus reproduces or transforms field structures
- Assessment of habitus acquisition and formation processes
- Evaluation of habitus adaptation and change mechanisms

## Quick Start
When a user requests habitus analysis:
1. **Identify** the habitus patterns of field actors
2. **Analyze** the relationship between habitus and field structure
3. **Examine** the practice logic and behavioral tendencies
4. **Assess** how habitus enables/constrains practice
5. **Evaluate** the correspondence between habitus and field

## Core Functions (Progressive Disclosure)

### Primary Functions
- **Disposition Analysis**: Identify action dispositions and behavioral tendencies
- **Embodied Knowledge**: Recognize embedded and embodied knowledge
- **Practice Logic**: Understand the logic of practice
- **Structure-Agency Mapping**: Map the relationship between habitus and field structure

### Secondary Functions
- **Habitus Formation**: Analyze processes of habitus acquisition
- **Correspondence Analysis**: Examine fit between habitus and field
- **Practice Constraints**: Identify how habitus constrains practice
- **Practice Enablers**: Recognize how habitus enables practice

### Advanced Functions
- **Habitus Transformation**: Analyze processes of habitus change
- **Misrecognition Assessment**: Examine mechanisms of misrecognition
- **Symbolic Violence**: Identify symbolic violence in habitus formation
- **Cross-field Analysis**: Examine habitus transfer between fields

## Detailed Instructions

### 1. Disposition Analysis
   - Identify the durable and transposable dispositions of field actors
   - Analyze the generative schemes underlying practice
   - Examine the cognitive and motivating structures
   - Map the embodied tendencies toward action
   - Consider the historical conditioning of dispositions

### 2. Embodied Knowledge Analysis
   - Identify the tacit knowledge embedded in actors
   - Analyze the practical mastery of field rules
   - Examine the intuitive understanding of field dynamics
   - Map the bodily techniques and skills
   - Consider the non-verbal and non-conscious aspects of knowledge

### 3. Practice Logic Analysis
   - Understand the logic of practice that transcends rules
   - Analyze the creative and improvisational aspects of action
   - Examine the economy of practice and minimal effort principles
   - Map the relationship between past experiences and present action
   - Consider the temporal and situational aspects of practice

### 4. Structure-Agency Relationship Analysis
   - Examine how habitus incorporates field structure
   - Analyze the correspondence between habitus and field
   - Map the relationship between objective conditions and subjective dispositions
   - Consider how habitus both reproduces and transforms field structure
   - Assess the dialectical relationship between habitus and field

### 5. Practice Enablement and Constraint Analysis
   - Identify how habitus enables certain practices
   - Analyze the constraints imposed by habitus on practice
   - Examine the selective perception of field opportunities
   - Map the range of possible actions delimited by habitus
   - Consider the creative potential of habitus

### 6. Habitus Formation Process Analysis
   - Analyze the social origins of habitus
   - Examine the processes of socialization and internalization
   - Consider the role of family, school, and peer groups
   - Map the relationship between social trajectory and habitus
   - Assess the impact of critical life experiences

### 7. Correspondence Assessment
   - Evaluate the fit between habitus and field structure
   - Analyze the correspondence between dispositions and opportunities
   - Examine the selection and adaptation processes
   - Map the relationship between habitus and field position
   - Consider the implications of correspondence for success in field

### 8. Change and Adaptation Analysis
   - Identify processes of habitus transformation
   - Analyze the impact of field changes on habitus
   - Examine mechanisms of habitus adaptation
   - Consider the resistance to change in habitus
   - Assess the conditions for habitus modification
