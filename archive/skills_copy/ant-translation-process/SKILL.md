# ANT Translation Process Analysis Skill

## Overview
ANT转译过程分析技能专注于追踪行动者网络理论中的核心概念——转译过程，包括问题化、利益化、征召和动员四个阶段。该技能帮助研究者理解如何将不同行动者的利益和关注点转化为共同行动，以及网络如何通过转译过程得以构建和稳定。

## When to Use This Skill
Use this skill when the user requests:
- Analysis of translation processes in network construction
- Tracing of problematization and interest alignment
- Study of enrolment and mobilization strategies
- Understanding of how controversies are resolved
- Examination of how facts or technologies are stabilized
- Analysis of how diverse actors are enrolled in a network
- Investigation of how resistance is overcome or accommodated

## Quick Start
When a user requests translation process analysis:
1. **Trace** the problematization phase
2. **Follow** the interessement and enrollment processes
3. **Analyze** the mobilization of allies
4. **Identify** moments of translation success or failure
5. **Assess** the stabilization of the network

## Core Functions (Progressive Disclosure)

### Primary Functions
- **Problematisation**: Identify the problem and interested parties
- **Interessement**: Trace the negotiation of interests and roles
- **Enrollment**: Analyze the enlistment of allies
- **Mobilization**: Examine the mobilization of resources and actors

### Secondary Functions
- **Controversy Mapping**: Identify and trace controversies and conflicts
- **Translation Failure Analysis**: Identify moments of translation breakdown
- **Alliance Building**: Examine how alliances are formed and maintained
- **Resource Mobilization**: Track how resources are enrolled in the network

### Advanced Functions
- **Symmetry Maintenance**: Analyze how symmetry is maintained across translations
- **Black-boxing Analysis**: Examine how processes become taken-for-granted
- **Network Stabilization**: Analyze how networks achieve stability
- **Translation Success/Failure**: Assess the effectiveness of translation processes

## Detailed Instructions

### 1. Problematization Phase Analysis
   - Identify the original problem or challenge
   - Trace how the problem is framed and defined
   - Identify the actors who are made to depend on the solution
   - Map the initial state of actor positions
   - Assess how the problem is made to seem relevant to different actors

### 2. Interessement Phase Analysis
   - Trace the negotiation processes between actors
   - Identify how actors' interests are aligned or modified
   - Analyze the mutual adjustments and accommodations
   - Map the evolving relationships between actors
   - Assess the degree of commitment achieved

### 3. Enrollment Phase Analysis
   - Identify how actors are enlisted as allies
   - Trace the recruitment strategies used
   - Analyze the representation of actors by others
   - Map the delegation of authority and action
   - Assess the stability of enrollments

### 4. Mobilization Phase Analysis
   - Trace how actors are moved to action
   - Analyze the translation of interests into actions
   - Map the mobilization of resources and capabilities
   - Identify the spokespersons and representatives
   - Assess the effectiveness of mobilization strategies

### 5. Controversy and Resistance Analysis
   - Identify points of controversy and resistance
   - Trace how controversies are managed or resolved
   - Analyze the actors who resist enrollment
   - Map the counter-mobilizations
   - Assess the impact of controversies on network formation

### 6. Translation Success/Failure Assessment
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of each translation phase
   - Identify factors that enabled or hindered translation
   - Assess the stability of achieved translations
   - Consider alternative translation possibilities
   - Analyze the consequences of successful/unsuccessful translations

## Parameters
- `translation_phase`: Focus on specific translation phases (problematisation, interessement, enrolment, mobilization)
- `controversy_level`: Degree of controversy in the network
- `actor_alignment`: Level of interest alignment achieved
- `enrollment_success`: Success rate of actor enrollment
- `stabilization_degree`: Degree of network stabilization
- `methodology`: Approach to translation analysis (ethnographic, historical, etc.)
- `cultural_context`: Cultural context considerations (especially for Chinese context)

## Examples

### Example 1: Technology Implementation
User: "Analyze the translation process of mobile payment adoption in China"
Response: Trace problematization of payment challenges, interessement of stakeholders, enrollment of users and merchants, mobilization of ecosystem.

### Example 2: Policy Implementation
User: "Study the translation process of environmental regulation adoption"
Response: Analyze problematization of environmental issues, enrollment of companies, mobilization of compliance mechanisms.

### Example 3: Scientific Innovation
User: "Examine the translation process of a new medical treatment"
Response: Trace problematization of health issue, enrollment of patients and doctors, mobilization of clinical trials and approvals.

## Quality Standards

- Apply translation framework rigorously (four phases)
- Trace processes chronologically and causally
- Consider both successful and failed translations
- Maintain focus on actor relationships and alignments
- Assess the stability and durability of translations

## Output Format

- Translation process timeline with phases
- Controversy mapping and resolution analysis
- Enrollment success/failure assessment
- Network stabilization evaluation
- Recommendations for improving translation processes

## Resources
- Actor-Network Theory literature on translation (Latour, Callon)
- Translation process analysis guides
- Case studies of successful network stabilizations
- Examples of translation in Chinese socio-technical contexts
