## Detailed Instructions

### 1. Network Topology Mapping
   - Create a comprehensive map of actor relationships
   - Identify the types of connections between actors
   - Map the overall structure of the network
   - Analyze the patterns of connections
   - Consider the boundaries of the network

### 2. Relationship Analysis
   - Assess the strength of different relationships
   - Identify the nature of connections (supportive, conflicting, neutral)
   - Analyze the directionality of relationships
   - Examine the quality and durability of connections
   - Consider the multiplicity of relationships

### 3. Centrality and Key Actor Analysis
   - Identify central actors in the network
   - Analyze the roles of key intermediaries
   - Assess the distribution of influence
   - Identify potential bottlenecks or vulnerabilities
   - Consider the redundancy of connections

### 4. Stability Assessment
   - Evaluate the factors maintaining network stability
   - Identify potential sources of instability
   - Assess the robustness of key connections
   - Analyze the mechanisms of network stabilization
   - Consider the costs of maintaining network connections

### 5. Dynamic Analysis
   - Trace changes in network structure over time
   - Identify moments of network transformation
   - Analyze the causes of network changes
   - Assess the impact of external events on the network
   - Consider potential future developments

### 6. Cohesion and Fragmentation Analysis
   - Assess the overall cohesion of the network
   - Identify subgroups or clusters within the network
   - Analyze the connections between subgroups
   - Consider the risks of fragmentation
   - Examine the mechanisms that maintain unity

### 7. Power and Influence Analysis
   - Map the distribution of power within the network
   - Identify actors with disproportionate influence
   - Analyze how power flows through the network
   - Consider mechanisms of resistance and control
   - Assess the democratization of influence

## Parameters
- `network_type`: Type of network (technological, scientific, organizational, etc.)
- `analysis_scope`: Scope of analysis (local, global, multi-scale)
- `time_frame`: Time frame for analysis (synchronic, diachronic)
